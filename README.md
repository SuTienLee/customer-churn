# customer-churn using python

This project utilized data from Kaggle. We aimed to define the problem that a credit card company may face and try to figure out **which features have a greater impact on churn**, whether we can **predict which customer would churn** and how to prevent them from doing so.

We started from defining the business problem, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and finally the recommendations after analyzing the dataset and evaluating the statistical model.

This project was contributed by MS Business Analytics and Information Management students at Purdue University:
